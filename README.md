Web Development Projects given by Bharat Intern 

1) Temperature Converter:
   A temperature converter created by me using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had specify three input boxes for taking temperatures in degree Celsius, degree Fahrenheit and 
   Kelvin. If we provide temperature in any one box then other two boxes will automatically get filled with their scales of temperatures. A clear button is also given to erase 
   all the values or inputs. I had also specify my symbol pk that represents my name.

2) Netflix Home-Page Clone:
   A Netflix Home-Page created by me using HTML and CSS. The Home-Page is completely responsive as it can works properly on small screens also.
