Web Development Projects given by Bharat Intern 

Temperature Converter A temperature converter created by me using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had specify three input boxes for taking temperatures in degree Celsius, 
degree Fahrenheit and Kelvin. If we provide temperature in any one box then other two boxes will automatically get filled with their scales of temperatures. A clear button is 
also given to erase all the values or inputs. I had also specify my symbol pk that represents my name.
